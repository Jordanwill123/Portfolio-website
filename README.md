# portfolio-website
This project is a personal portfolio website designed to showcase my skills, experiences, and projects, including an interactive chatbot for user engagement. It features sections for an introduction, resume download, GitHub project links, and a contact form, all styled with responsive design for a professional online presence.

Welcome to my personal portfolio! I'm Jordan Williams, and this website serves as a comprehensive showcase of my skills, experiences, and projects. As a senior at Bowie State University studying Computer Technology with a focus on Network Infrastructure, along with my work experience and interests, I created this portfolio to provide an engaging and professional way to highlight who I am and what I do.

The website is designed to be both visually appealing and user-friendly. The Home section introduces me and my background, including a picture, so you can get to know me a bit better. In the About section, I go into more detail about my diverse experiences in business management, customer service, food service, and technology, including my current role as the Owner and CEO of Lenair Auto Detailing. I also explain my technical skills, including proficiency in Microsoft Word, JavaScript, HTML5, and my studies in Network Infrastructure.

In the Projects section, you’ll find links to my GitHub repositories where I showcase some of my coding work and other projects I’ve worked on. Whether you're a potential employer or collaborator, this gives you a deeper look at my capabilities. The Resume section includes an option to download my updated resume, where you can view my complete professional background and qualifications. 

For anyone interested in reaching out or connecting with me, the Contact section provides a link to my LinkedIn profile, making it easy to connect with me professionally. 

One of the interactive features of my portfolio is the chatbot. It's located at the bottom right of the page, and you can use it to ask questions about my background, experience, and skills. I’ve integrated this feature to create a more engaging experience for visitors, allowing you to interact with the website in a dynamic way.

To make things even easier for visitors, I’ve included a QR code at the bottom of the page that you can scan with your phone to access my portfolio instantly. This makes it easy to share my portfolio at networking events or on printed materials.

Overall, my portfolio is designed to be a clear, interactive, and professional presentation of who I am and what I can offer. It’s optimized for ease of use, with a clean layout that adjusts to different devices, ensuring that whether you're on mobile, tablet, or desktop, the experience is seamless. I hope this portfolio provides you with a good understanding of my skills, my passion for technology, and my experience in multiple industries. Thank you for visiting, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or want to connect!
